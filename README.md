# NMSProtocol
Lib for packet manipulation for Minecraft.
Uses NMS with a little Reflection, so this lib is update-friendly and should work for a wide range of versions.

# Reload-friendly
You can use the /reload with this plugin.

# WIP
Performances not tested, althrough I used very little Reflection which will be called only on server startup.
Per-connection protocol injection is done only with direct calls.
